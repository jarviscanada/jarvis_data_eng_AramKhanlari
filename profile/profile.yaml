# Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: "Developed a Linux-based resource monitoring system on Rocky to collect CPU, memory, and disk usage metrics using Bash/Shell scripts and crontab. Containerized a PostgreSQL RDBMS using Docker to store host data and implemented analytical SQL queries for usage reporting and cluster health diagnostics. Followed a simplified SDLC to design, implement, test, and deploy the solution."
